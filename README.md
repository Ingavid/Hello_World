# Hello_World

I live in a pretty messy room, right now, both physically and metaphorically. I know that I love animation and storytelling, programming and making games. I also know that I love machines and I want to do everything I can do to make sure the human race is a successful bunch of creatures for as long as we can be. Can I learn the skills to do all these things that I love? Will I be able to support myself and my family in the meaentime? Will I be smart enough to make decisions that help humanity succeed and help us move from fossil fuels to renewable, sustainable infrastructre?

Can I have a life that helps everyone else at the same time as living out days that I enjoy?
